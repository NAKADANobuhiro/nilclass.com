## Static site for nilclass.com

Runs on [ruhoh](http://ruhoh.com/) 3.0 but 3.0 is not officially released yet!

Course content format uses `.nilclass` extension. The parser is in the plugins directory.

Sorry guys, but you won't be able to run this site generator without hacks to the unpublished ruhoh 3.0 version -- hacks which have yet to be published. It's not a secret, it's just that I'm trying to be heavily _product_ oriented so underlying tech-related are just plumbing that has to wait.
